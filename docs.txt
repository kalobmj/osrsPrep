    have a api url to call to get ge price and id using a name search query. this is how we will get our id for each item. then we will use that id to get its price, icon image and such.
        can use the basic serching using weirdgloop to fetch the items id. then use that id to fetch the rest of the details (maybe, this requires bypass cors, and so far I only know how to do this using a backend server)
            we found a workaround using: 'https://corsproxy.io?url=<APIURLHERE>'
